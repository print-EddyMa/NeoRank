This directory contains training and example data for NeoRank.

## Subdirectories

- **raw/** - Raw IEDB data files (not included in repo)
- **processed/** - Preprocessed data after feature extraction

## Raw Data Format

Download IEDB data as tab-separated values (TSV):

1. `epitope.tsv` - Epitope sequences
2. `tcell.tsv` - T-cell assay results

See `raw/download_instructions.md` for download steps.

## Processed Data

Generated by `scripts/train_model.py`:

- Training set with extracted features
- Test set for evaluation
- Cached NetMHCpan predictions

## Storage Notes

Raw data files are typically 10-15 MB each. Processed data with features may reach 50+ MB for full IEDB.

**.gitignore** excludes:
- `*.tsv` (raw data)
- `*.pkl` (processed pickles)
- `*.h5` (HDF5 files)
